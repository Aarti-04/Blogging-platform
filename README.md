Blog Posting Platform (Backend)
This project is a simple blog posting platform where users can register, log in, and create blog posts. Users can dynamically generate categories and create posts associated with a particular category. Additionally, users can add comments to posts, and others can reply to these comments. All users can view comments and replies, fostering interaction within the platform.

Key Features
User Authentication & Authorization:

Authentication: Only authenticated users can create posts and categories.
Authorization: Users can only delete their own posts. One user cannot delete posts created by another user.
Post Viewing: All users, including non-authenticated users, can view posts without needing to log in.
Dynamic Categories: Users can create custom categories and associate posts with them.

CRUD Operations:

Authenticated users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on their posts.
Users must be logged in to create or manage posts and categories.
Comment System: Users can comment on posts, and others can reply to those comments. Comments are visible to all users.

Backend API: This project is backend-only and provides APIs to manage users, posts, categories, and comments.

Project Details
This project primarily focuses on authentication and CRUD operations:

Authenticated Users: Only logged-in users can create and manage posts and categories.
Authorized Actions: Users can only delete or modify their own posts; they cannot modify or delete posts created by others.
View without Login: All posts can be viewed by any user, even without logging in. Authentication is only required for creating posts and categories.
This project was created as a 3-day demo during my internship and was presented in my office.
